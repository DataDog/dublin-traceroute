Dublin Traceroute is a NAT-aware multipath traceroute tool.

And this page is just informational. **You should really read more at https://dublin-traceroute.net** .

If you are looking for the Python bindings, check out [python-dublin-traceroute](https://github.com/insomniacslk/python-dublin-traceroute). This module contains most functionalities, including diagrams and statistic analysis.

Feedback is extremely welcome! Find my contacts on https://insomniac.slackware.it or post in the [Dublin Traceroute mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dublin-traceroute) .

But, in a few words, you can run traceroutes in multi-path networks (i.e. with ECMP load-balancing enabled), recognize NATs, have nice diagrams like the one below, export to JSON, and do this with a command-line tool, a C++ library or a Python library.
